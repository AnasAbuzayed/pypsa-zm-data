# pypsa-zm-data

This repository hosts data required to run energy system planning scenarions for Zambia within [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth). 

# Design

`pypsa-zm-data` hosts no extra code, but only additional data add validation notebooks for `pypsa-earth`. The `configs` folder contains `config.yaml's` aka option files that allow `pypsa-earth` to create model outputs. The `data` folder contains any extra data or data deletion requirements. The `notebooks` folder contains modified versions of the validation template given in the [pypsa-earth/documentation](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/documentation/tree/main/notebooks/validation).
